## Day 1:  
#### Figured out the libraries needed to be used and installed them. Faced some problem and fixed them.  
  
## Day 2:  
#### In the continuation of taking baby steps, I learnt how to create python environment using anaconda as for some libraries different versions of python was needed. Read about face demarkation points which were needed. These were theoretical stuffs.  
  
## Day 3:  
#### Today I installed the Visual C++ and all the pre requisites needed for dlib module and then installed the dlib. These also went hand in hand installing various other libraries needed for image processing. I also learnt to input image using openCV in Python.  

## Day 4:  
#### I learnt inputting and displaying images using python module OpenCV. Used functions like imread() and imshow() to take and display the image respectively. The input image's absolute path is to be entered by the user. The image was filled in the whole window and didn't fit in it. So used the resize() function.  
  
## Day 5:  
#### Inputted two images using the absolute path of that image. The processing on those images will be done using dlib and the goal is to exchange the face features of the images.  
  
## Day 7:  
#### Learnt usage and functionality of dlib and tried to identify 68 feature points of the face to know the features of face. Encountered several method calling errors which were partly resolved.  
  
## Day 8:  
#### The whole day passed in error only. So 13tried rectifying the error and also looked for methods of creating a flask app.  
  
## Day 9:  
#### Found and fixed the error which was just due to the wrong argument. Worked with the identification of feature points on the face. A .dat file was needed for this which I added.  

## Day 10:  
#### Added 2nd face picture and joined the dots of facial features of the faces and now these are ready to be extracted.  
  
## Day 11:  
#### Detected dots and features of second image and joined dot and extracted the dots.  
  
## Day 12:  
#### Stored the joined dots as a form of triangles and extracted them to be pasted on the other image for swapping.  
  
## Day 13:  
#### Encountered various errors and problems today. Boolean error in numpy.where() function and dots joined started malfunctioning.  
  
## Day 14:  
#### Tried plotting triabngles but again failed in it. Resolved various errors. Points extraction yet not possible.
