Timeline
Week 1:  (Using OpenCV)
In this week I will work on the process of Image face Selection. I will learn how these things are done and make ways through it.
Week 2: (Using OpenCV)
I will work on the detection process of these images which are selected. 
Week 3: (Using OpenCV)
I will work on taking the face dots from first image and mask it on the second and then save it to the destination image
Week 4:
I will start to make a website and then host this on the website which will be available for use.
Week 5:
I will learn how this model will be applied on a website and will do this for this week
Week 6:
I will host this model on AWS and will fix the issues coming in between.
Week 7:
Check the input and output, will ensure the proper functioning of the whole model. I will also try to improve it.
