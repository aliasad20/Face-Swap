Timeline  
  
Week 1:  (Using OpenCV)  
In this week I will work on the process of Image face Selection. I will learn how these things are done and make ways through it.    
    
Week 2: (Using OpenCV)  
I will work on the detection process of these images which are selected.  Work on masking the face dots and swapping will be done. This would be in turn saved to a destination image.  
    
Week 3: (Website development to present my model)  
I will start to make a website and then host this model on the website which will be available for use.  
    
Week 4:  
I will conclude the website and will learn for any scope of improvement if present.  
    
Week 5:  
I will host this model on AWS and will fix the issues coming in between.  
    
Week 6:  
Check the input and output, will ensure the proper functioning of the whole model. I will also try to improve and optimise it.
